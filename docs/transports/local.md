The Local transport is special. Instead of binding to a socket like the TCP transport, or communicating over HTTP, like the HTTP Transport, it mounts a service as a internal function.

    Using the local transport is fantastic for development, but you may want to look into using another transport if you're planning to support horizontal scaling.
