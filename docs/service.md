## What is a Service?

TODO

## Creating one

Before you create a service, you need to understand how **Transports** fit in. Head over **LINK** here and read the overview.
For these examples, we are going to use the TCP transport.

### new Service([transport])

Passing an optional transport to this service is equivalent to calling *Service.addTransport*

```js

// create a TCP transport that communicates over port 11111
var transport = new ht.Transport.TCP({ port: 11111 });

// Initialise a new Service instance
var service = new ht.Service(transport);
```

## Instance Methods

### Service.addTransport(transport[, callback])

*Service.addTransport* takes an instance of a transport as the first argument, and an optional callback as the second.

If the service is currently listening, as soon as the transport has been added, it will start listening too.

If you pass a callback, it will be called when the transport has been added.

### Service.on(method, [schema,] fn)

*Service.on* takes a method, an optional schema, and a callback.

    Although passing in a schema is optional, it is <b>highly</b> recommended.

### Service.before(fn[, options])

*Service.before* adds a function that will get executed **before** the function for each method gets called.

The optional options object can have the following properties.

| Name   | Type   | Example         | Description                                             |
|--------|--------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| method | string | "reverseString" | Restrict this middleware to only the call for *method*. |

### Service.after(fn[, options]);

*Service.after* adds a function that will get executed **after** the function for each method gets called.

The optional options object can have the following properties.

| Name   | Type   | Example         | Description                                             |
|--------|--------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| method | string | "reverseString" | Restrict this middleware to only the call for *method*. |

### Service.listen([callback])

*Service.listen* will make all transports start listening for requests. 

*callback* will be called on when all transports are listening, or with an optional error if something went wrong.

### Service.stop([callback])

*Service.stop* will make all transports stop listening for requests.

*callback* will be called on when all transports are not listening aynmore, or with an optional error if something went wrong.

### Service.call(method[, data], callback)

*Service.call* allows you to call a method on **this** service, without having to make an actual requests.

Its signature is the same as *Client.call* without **service**.
